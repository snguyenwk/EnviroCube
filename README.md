# EnviroCube

CS4605 Project : 

We are creating a full-stack project utilizing an Arduino Nano R3 as well as multiple components in order to create the EnviroCube. This will essentially be a 
portable temperature, air quality, noise pollution, and humidity tracker. All of the data will be transferred towards our user-friendly front end webpage and 
allow our users to see trends in their local atmosphere. We will also be implementing local data warehousing in case our users want to maintain this data in 
CSV files for their own purposes.

Please download all the files in this repository in order to have it be fully functional for your use.

Thank you,
The team at EnviroCube.
